# REST API for offering writing conferences to students

## Installation

```
pip install Flask
python app.py
```

## Description

Let's tutors create timeslots where they offer sessions. When students select a timeslot, a new conference date is created and an email is sent to both student and tutor for confirmation.

## Implementation

Using the Python micro-framework Flask, this is a REST API for a tutor/student app to connect to.
